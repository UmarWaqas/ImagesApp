# ImagesApp

Decisions made to solve certain aspects of this task.
* Decisions made because of restricted time:
* Kotlin is used as primary language
* MVVM is selected as architecture
* Retrofit 2 is used
* Coroutines are used for network call
* LiveData is used which is replaced data binding previously
* Photoview lib is used for full screen image with zooming
* What would be the first thing to improve or add if there had been more time:
* Adding Unit testing
* adding Hilt as Dependency Injection
